            <h2>A RADICAL VISION OF PERFUME-MAKING</h2>
            <h3>Fashion’s wild child has always enjoyed pushing the boundaries between the feminine and the masculine. Gaultier has created a range of original and powerful fragrances that boldly combine masculine and feminine perfume notes. Lavender and vanilla for Le Male, pear for Ultra Male and brown caramel for Scandal pour Homme. JPG loves to flout convention and celebrate the alchemy of genders as with Gaultier², an inclusive, nonconformist unisex fragrance designed for everyone.</h3>
            <h4>For 50 years, fearlessness, freedom and joie de vivre have been core JPG values. Creativity provides a limitless realm for self-expression in which the diverse nature of Gaultier’s approach to aesthetics can be showcased. Creativity is also a realm for commitments in which Jean Paul Gaultier can share his convictions, stances and views of society. Whether it concerns fashion or fragrances, for JPG there is no such thing as creativity without a message, without subversion and without controversy. </h4>

            <h5>What is Gaultier’s unique touch? All of his fragrances contain a generous dose of humour and provocation! 
                There is only one rule and that is to create inclusive fragrances that are not afraid to flout convention.</h5>            <h6>BELIEVE</h6>
